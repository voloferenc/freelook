## Feature
* Receive your hotmail / outlook / office 365 online from the desktop app
* Close to minimise
* Dock tray support
* System notification
* Network connection detection
* Customized setting
    * Ads block as your control
    * Switch between outlook and office 365

## Download
The released application can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/eNkru/electron-outlook/releases).

## Troubleshot
`Some Linux distributions has the issue to display the reciptons in the To and CC fields.`

The workaround is set some invalid values in the Ads Blocker settings. The settings come with the default value, you need to input some random numbers to overwrite them.

`Desktop Integration not updated/created when using AppImage`

Since electron-builder 21 desktop integration is not a part of produced AppImage file anymore. Electron builder recommends [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) to install AppImages and create Desktop Integration or to create the desktop files manually.

## Build Pre-Request
* [GIT](https://git-scm.com/)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Build & Install
Clone the repository and run in development mode.
```
git clone https://github.com/eNkru/freelook.git
cd freelook
npm i
npm run start
```
Build the application 
```
npm run dist:linux
```

Ezután hibát fog írni, be kell lépni a dist könyvtárba és ott lesz a deb fájl.


This will build a predefined AppImage & deb packages in the dist folder. AppImage can be run in most popular linux distributions with the support. Deb is only for debian & ubuntu distributions.

```
npm version (new release version)
git push origin master
git push origin --tags
npm publish
```
